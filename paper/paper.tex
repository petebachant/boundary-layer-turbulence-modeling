\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

First, we seek to generate a new Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS)
turbulence model that accurately predicts a turbulent DNS flow field.
We do this by creating new PDE terms based on the mean velocity and pressure
fields,
then use a simple regression technique to solve for the coefficients of
these terms.

Then, we simulate the flow field with this new model, showing how it is
much more accurate than a laminar model, i.e., one with no turbulence
parameterization.

\section{Notation and style}\label{notstyle}
 Generally any queries concerning notation and journal style can be answered by viewing recent pages in the Journal. However, the following guide provides the key points to note. It is expected that Journal style and mathematical notation will be followed, and authors should take care to define all variables or entities upon first use. Also note that footnotes are not normally accepted.  Abbreviations must be defined at first use, glossaries or lists/tables of abbreviations are not permitted.

\subsection{Mathematical notation}
\subsubsection{Setting variables, functions, vectors, matrices etc}
\begin{itemize} \label{sec:MathNot}
\item {\bf Italic font} should be used for denoting variables, with multiple-letter symbols avoided except in the case of dimensionless numbers such as $\Rey$, $\Pran$ and $\Pen$ (Reynolds, Prandtl, and P\'eclet numbers respectively, which are defined as \verb}\Rey}, \verb}\Pran} and \verb}\Pen} in the template).\\
\item {\bf Upright Roman font} (or upright Greek where appropriate) should be used for:\\
\begin {enumerate}
\item (vI) label, e.g.  T. t (transpose)\\
\item Fixed operators: sin, log, d, $\Delta$, exp etc.\\
\item Constants: i ($\sqrt{-1}$), $\upi$ (defined as \verb}\upi}),e  etc.\\
\item Special Functions: $\Ai$, $\Bi$ (Airy functions, defined as \verb}\Ai} and \verb}\Bi}), $\Real$ (real part, defined as \verb}\Real}), $\Imag$ (imaginary part, defined as \verb}\Imag}), etc.\\[-4pt]
\item Physical units: cm, s, etc.\\[-4pt]
\item Abbreviations: c.c. (complex conjugate), h.o.t. (higher-order terms), DNS, etc.\\[-4pt]
\end {enumerate}
\item {\bf Bold italic font} (or bold sloping Greek) should be used for vectors (with the centred dot for a scalar product also in bold): $\boldsymbol{i \cdot j}$\\[-4pt]
\item {\bf Bold sloping sans serif font}, defined by the \verb}\mathsfbi} macro, should be used for tensors and matrices: $\mathsfbi{D}$ \\[-4pt]
\item {\bf Calligraphic font} (for example $\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{R}$) can be used as an alternative to italic when the same letter denotes a different quantity use \verb}\mathcal} in \LaTeX)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other symbols}  Large numbers  that are not scientific powers should not include commas, but should use a non-breaking space, and use the form 1600 or 16 000 or 160 000.
Use \textit{O} to denote `of the order of', not the \LaTeX\ $\mathcal{O}$.

The product symbol ($\times$) should only be used to denote multiplication where an equation is broken over more than one line, to denote a cross product, or between numbers . The $\boldsymbol {\cdot}$ symbol should not be used, except to denote a scalar product of vectors specifically.

\subsubsection{Example Equations}
 This section contains sample equations in the JFM style. Please refer to the {\LaTeX} source file for examples of how to display such equations in your manuscript.

\begin{equation}
  (\nabla^2+k^2)G_s=(\nabla^2+k^2)G_a=0
  \label{Helm}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \bnabla\bcdot\boldsymbol{v} = 0,\quad \nabla^{2}P=
    \bnabla\bcdot(\boldsymbol{v}\times \boldsymbol{w}).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  G_s,G_a\sim 1 / (2\upi)\ln r
  \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad r\equiv|P-Q|\rightarrow 0,
  \label{singular}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left. \begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle\frac{\p G_s}{\p y}=0
  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,\\[8pt]
\displaystyle  G_a=0
  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,
 \end{array}\right\}
  \label{symbc}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
  -\frac{1}{2\upi} \int_0^{\infty} \gamma^{-1}[\mathrm exp(-k\gamma|y-\eta|)
   + \mathrm exp(-k\gamma(2d-y-\eta))] \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t,
   \qquad 0<y,\quad \eta<d,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \gamma(t) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      -\mathrm{i}(1-t^2)^{1/2}, & t\le 1 \\[2pt]
      (t^2-1)^{1/2},         & t>1.
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

\[
  -\frac{1}{2\upi}
   \pvi B(t)\frac{\cosh k\gamma(d-y)}{\gamma\sinh k\gamma d}
   \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t
\]

\begin{equation}
  G = -\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{i} (H_0(kr)+H_0(kr_1))
    - \frac{1}{\upi} \pvi\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\kgd}}%
    {\gamma\sinh\kgd} \cosh k\gamma(d-y) \cosh k\gamma(d-\eta)
\end{equation}

Note that when equations are included in definitions, it may be suitable to render them in line, rather than in the equation environment: $\boldsymbol{n}_q=(-y^{\prime}(\theta),
x^{\prime}(\theta))/w(\theta)$.
Now $G_a=\squart Y_0(kr)+\Gat$ where
$r=\{[x(\theta)-x(\psi)]^2 + [y(\theta)-y(\psi)]^2\}^{1/2}$ and $\Gat$ is
regular as $kr\ttz$. However, any fractions displayed like this, other than $\thalf$ or $\squart$, must be written on the line, and not stacked (ie 1/3).

\begin{eqnarray}
  \ndq\left(\frac{1}{4} Y_0(kr)\right) & \sim &
    \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}
    [x^{\prime\prime}(\theta)y^{\prime}(\theta)-
    y^{\prime\prime}(\theta)x^{\prime}(\theta)] \nonumber\\
  & = & \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}
    [\rho^{\prime}(\theta)\rho^{\prime\prime}(\theta)
    - \rho^2(\theta)-2\rho^{\prime 2}(\theta)]
    \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad kr\ttz . \label{inteqpt}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{2}\phi_i = \frac{\upi}{M} \sumjm\phi_j K_{ij}^a w_j,
  \qquad i=1,\,\ldots,\,M,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  K_{ij}^a = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \p G_a(\theta_i,\theta_j)/\p n_q, & i\neq j \\[2pt]
      \p\Gat(\theta_i,\theta_i)/\p n_q
      + [\rho_i^{\prime}\rho_i^{\prime\prime}-\rho_i^2-2\rho_i^{\prime 2}]
      / 4\upi w_i^3, & i=j.
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
Let $f(z)$ be a trial \citet[][pp.~231--232]{Batchelor59} function defined on $[0,1]$.  Let $\varLambda_1$ denote
the ground-state eigenvalue for $-\mathrm{d}^2g/\mathrm{d} z^2=\varLambda g$,
where $g$ must satisfy $\pm\mathrm{d} g/\mathrm{d} z+\alpha g=0$ at $z=0,1$
for some non-negative constant~$\alpha$.  Then for any $f$ that is not
identically zero we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{\displaystyle
  \alpha(f^2(0)+f^2(1)) + \int_0^1 \left(
  \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} z} \right)^2 \mathrm{d} z}%
  {\displaystyle \int_0^1 f^2\mathrm{d} z}
\ge \varLambda_1 \ge
\left( \frac{-\alpha+(\alpha^2+8\upi^2\alpha)^{1/2}}{4\upi} \right)^2.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
Any non-zero trial function $f$ which satisfies the boundary condition
$f(0)=f(1)=0$ always satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^1 \left( \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} z} \right)^2 \mathrm{d} z.
